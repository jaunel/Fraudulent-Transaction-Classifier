# Fraudulent-Transaction-Classifier

Developed a classification model to detect fraudulent transactions in an imbalanced dataset of credit card transactions. The best model achieved high performance metrics, including an accuracy of 99.95%, precision of 0.97, recall of 0.85, and an F1 score of 0.91 on the testing set. It also covers key data preprocessing steps, including outlier removal using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, to improve the performance of the model.
